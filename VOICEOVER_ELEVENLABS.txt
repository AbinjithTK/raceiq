Meet RaceIQ - your AI-powered race engineer that turns raw telemetry into winning strategies. Let's see it in action with real Toyota GR Cup data from Barber Motorsports Park.

Here's live telemetry visualization. Watch as we track speed, braking pressure, and G-forces around every corner. The 3D track map shows exactly where you are, with real-time coaching tips appearing at critical points - brake earlier here, carry more speed through turn 5.

The AI analyzes your driving against the fastest laps in the dataset. It identifies exactly where you're losing time. Sector 2 - you're losing 0.8 seconds. The AI suggests: 'Trail brake deeper into turn 7, maintain higher minimum speed.' Your lap potential shows you're capable of a 1:42.3 - that's 1.2 seconds faster than your current best.

Now for race strategy. The system predicts tire degradation based on your driving style and track conditions. Your fronts will drop off after lap 18. The AI recommends pitting on lap 19 during the yellow flag window. Pit prediction accounts for traffic, fuel load, and tire wear - giving you the optimal strategy to gain positions.

Here's where it gets powerful. Compare your performance across multiple tracks. You're strong in high-speed corners but losing time in technical sections. The AI identifies this pattern across all circuits and suggests specific drills to improve.
