    "question": "What is understeer and how do I fix it?",
    "answer": "Understeer = front tires lose grip first, car won't turn. Causes: Too much entry speed, early throttle, wrong line, cold front tires. Fixes: Brake earlier, slower entry, later apex, trail brake more, reduce throttle mid-corner. Setup: Increase front tire pressure, reduce front wing, soften front springs. Driving around it: Patience, let car rotate before throttle.",

    "question": "What is oversteer and how do I fix it?",
    "answer": "Oversteer = rear tires lose grip first, car rotates too much. Causes: Too much throttle, lift-off mid-corner, cold rear tires, aggressive inputs. Fixes: Smoother throttle, avoid sudden lift, earlier apex, reduce trail braking. Setup: Increase rear tire pressure, add rear wing, soften rear springs. Driving around it: Gentle throttle application, catch slides early with steering.",

    "question": "How does weight transfer affect handling?",
    "answer": "Weight transfer: Braking = weight to front (more front grip, less rear). Accelerating = weight to rear (more rear grip, less front). Cornering = weight to outside (outside tires do more work). Use it: Trail brake to keep weight on front for turn-in, smooth throttle to transfer weight to rear for traction. Sudden inputs cause weight shift = loss of grip.",

    "question": "How does tire pressure affect performance?",
    "answer": "Tire pressure effects: Too low: More grip but overheats, wears faster, sluggish response. Too high: Less grip, bouncy, uneven wear, but cooler temps. Optimal: 30-35 PSI (hot) for GR86. Adjust: +2 PSI if overheating, -2 PSI if not warming up. Check after 3-5 laps when hot. Front/rear balance affects handling (higher front = less understeer).",
