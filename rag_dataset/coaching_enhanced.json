    "question": "What is the optimal racing line?",
    "answer": "The optimal racing line maximizes corner exit speed: Enter wide, turn in at the correct point, hit the apex at minimum speed (late apex usually best), exit wide with full throttle. Key principle: 'Slow in, fast out' - prioritize exit speed, especially before straights.",

    "question": "How do I improve my braking technique?",
    "answer": "Effective braking: 1) Brake in a straight line before turn-in, 2) Apply maximum pressure quickly (70-85 bar), 3) Trail brake: gradually release as you turn in, 4) Feel for lock-up, 5) Finish braking before apex. Practice threshold braking for best results.",

    "question": "How do I apply throttle smoothly?",
    "answer": "Smooth throttle application: Begin at apex when unwinding steering, progressive application (0→100% gradually), match to steering angle (less steering = more throttle), feel for wheelspin, full throttle when straight. Smooth = fast and preserves tires.",

    "question": "How do I extend tire life?",
    "answer": "Extend tire life by: 1) Smooth inputs (gradual throttle/brake), 2) Avoid wheelspin, 3) Minimize sliding, 4) Proper tire temps (25-35°C optimal), 5) Strategic lift-and-coast. Trade 0.2-0.3s/lap early to gain 1-2s/lap advantage late in stint.",

    "question": "How do I drive more consistently?",
    "answer": "Build consistency through: 1) Reference points (braking markers, turn-in points, apexes), 2) Repeatable technique, 3) Smooth driving, 4) Mental focus, 5) Physical fitness. Aim for ±0.5s lap time variation. Consistency beats occasional fast laps.",
