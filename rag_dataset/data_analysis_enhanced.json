    "question": "How do teams analyze speed execution through data?",
    "answer": "Advanced speed analysis involves: 1) Corner phase breakdown - Divide each corner into entry, mid-corner (apex), and exit phases. Measure speed at each point. 2) Braking analysis - Track brake pressure, brake point location, trail braking profile. Compare to reference lap. 3) Throttle application - Measure throttle position vs steering angle. Smooth correlation = good technique. 4) Lateral G-force - Peak lateral G indicates cornering speed. Compare across laps to track consistency. 5) Minimum speed point - Where driver reaches slowest speed in corner. Earlier = better exit. Teams can identify 0.1-0.3s improvements per corner through detailed analysis.",

    "question": "What metrics measure driver consistency?",
    "answer": "Consistency is measured through: 1) Lap time standard deviation - Elite drivers: ±0.3s, Good: ±0.5s, Average: ±0.8s. 2) Sector time variation - Analyze consistency in each sector separately. 3) Stint degradation curve - How lap times increase with tire wear. Consistent drivers have smoother curves. 4) Mistake frequency - Count lock-ups, track limits, spins per session. 5) Reference lap delta - How close each lap is to personal best. Consistent drivers can maintain 99% of best pace for entire stint. Consistency is often more valuable than raw speed in endurance racing.",

    "question": "How is car management measured quantitatively?",
    "answer": "Car management tracking includes: 1) Tire management - Thermal cameras show tire temperature distribution. Even temps = good management. Track stint length vs predicted. 2) Brake management - Monitor brake disc temps, pad wear. Smooth braking preserves brakes for full race. 3) Fuel consumption - Compare actual vs predicted consumption. Efficient drivers save 1-2 laps of fuel. 4) Component stress - Measure G-forces, curb strikes, gear shifts. Smooth drivers reduce wear. 5) Degradation rate - Compare lap time drop-off to teammates. Good management = slower degradation. Teams can quantify how much time car management saves over a race.",

    "question": "How do teams measure driver adaptability?",
    "answer": "Adaptability is quantified through: 1) Wet vs dry pace - Compare lap time percentage in wet vs dry. Adaptable drivers lose less time in wet. 2) New track learning - Measure improvement rate at unfamiliar circuits. Fast learners reach 98% pace in fewer laps. 3) Setup sensitivity - Test performance with different setups. Adaptable drivers perform well with various configurations. 4) Simulator correlation - Compare sim pace to real-world pace across conditions. 5) Tire compound adaptation - Performance across different tire compounds. 6) Temperature range - Consistency across hot and cold conditions. Adaptable drivers are valuable for teams racing in varied conditions.",

Consistent performers: >40%. 3) Pole position rate - Qualifying performance indicator. >15% shows raw speed. 4) Points per race - Average points scored. Accounts for consistency and speed. 5) Teammate comparison - Head-to-head qualifying and race results vs teammate. Should win >60%. 6) Incident rate - Crashes and penalties per race. Lower is better. 7) Wet weather performance - Specific wet race results. Separates talent. These stats help teams identify promising talent for development programs.",
