    "question": "How does a team develop race strategy?",
    "answer": "Professional race strategy involves: 1) Pre-race simulations - Use historical data to model different pit stop scenarios, fuel loads, and tire strategies. 2) Real-time analysis - Monitor live telemetry and timing to adjust strategy during the race. 3) Scenario planning - Prepare for safety cars, weather changes, and incidents. 4) Competitor tracking - Watch rival strategies and react accordingly. 5) Risk assessment - Balance aggressive vs conservative approaches based on championship position. Data-driven strategy can gain 5-10 seconds per race through optimal decisions.",

    "question": "What does a data analysis team do in racing?",
    "answer": "A professional data team provides critical insights: 1) Telemetry review - Analyze thousands of data points per lap (speed, throttle, brake, G-forces, tire temps). 2) Performance comparison - Compare driver to driver, lap to lap, corner to corner. 3) Setup optimization - Identify which setup changes improve performance. 4) Predictive modeling - Forecast tire degradation, fuel consumption, and pit windows. 5) Real-time support - Provide live feedback to race engineer during sessions. Expert analysts can find 0.5-1.0s per lap through data insights.",

    "question": "How important is pit crew performance?",
    "answer": "Pit crew excellence is crucial for race outcomes: 1) Consistency - A well-drilled crew executes 15-20 second stops repeatedly without errors. 2) Practice - Top teams practice pit stops daily, not just at races. 3) Communication - Clear signals and calls prevent mistakes under pressure. 4) Equipment - Proper tools, wheel guns, and jacks maintained to perfection. 5) Contingency planning - Prepared for issues like stuck wheels or fuel rig problems. A 2-second faster pit stop can mean the difference between winning and losing. Flawless execution gains positions.",

    "answer": "Comprehensive driver support includes: 1) Simulator access - High-fidelity sim for track learning and setup testing. 2) Race engineer - Dedicated engineer who knows the driver's style and preferences. 3) Data review - Post-session analysis with engineers and coaches. 4) Physical training - Fitness programs tailored for racing demands. 5) Mental coaching - Sports psychologists for mental performance. 6) Nutrition - Proper diet and hydration plans for race weekends. Professional support helps drivers perform at their peak consistently.",

    "question": "How should a race engineer work with their driver?",
    "answer": "The engineer-driver relationship is critical: 1) Trust building - Develop mutual respect and understanding over time. 2) Communication style - Learn how the driver prefers to receive information (detailed vs concise). 3) Setup philosophy - Understand driver preferences (stable vs responsive, understeer vs oversteer). 4) Race management - Provide calm, clear instructions during high-pressure moments. 5) Development focus - For young drivers, balance performance with learning and growth. A strong engineer-driver partnership can find 0.5-1.0s per lap through better communication and setup.",
