    "answer": "Toyota GR Cup points (typical): 1st=25, 2nd=18, 3rd=15, 4th=12, 5th=10, 6th=8, 7th=6, 8th=4, 9th=2, 10th=1. Bonus: Fastest lap=1 point (if in top 10). Strategy: Consistency beats occasional wins. P5 every race > P1 then DNF. Protect points when leading championship. Take risks when behind. Calculate points needed vs races remaining.",

    "question": "When should I take risks vs play it safe?",
    "answer": "Risk assessment: Take risks when: Behind in championship, late in season, need to make up positions, nothing to lose. Play safe when: Leading championship, early in season, in points position, mechanical issues. Calculate: Is potential gain worth potential loss? P5 guaranteed vs 50% chance at P3 (risk DNF) = take P5 if leading championship.",

    "answer": "Focus on: 1) Tracks that suit your style (technical vs flowing), 2) Tracks with most points available (double-headers), 3) Tracks where you're competitive (maximize points), 4) Tracks where rivals struggle (gain advantage). Analyze: Your best tracks (prioritize), your worst tracks (improve or minimize damage), rivals' strengths (prepare to defend).",
