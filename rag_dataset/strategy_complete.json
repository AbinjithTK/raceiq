    "question": "What's the best strategy for Barber Motorsports Park?",
    "answer": "Strategy for Barber Motorsports Park: Shorter lap length means more laps and more opportunities to make up positions. Moderate tire wear allows for aggressive driving throughout the stint. The clockwise direction affects tire wear patterns. Typical pit window is laps 12-15 or 18-22 in a 27-lap race. Track position is crucial.",
