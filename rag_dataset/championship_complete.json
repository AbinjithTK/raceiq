    "answer": "Points: 1st=25, 2nd=18, 3rd=15, 4th=12, 5th=10, 6th=8, 7th=6, 8th=4, 9th=2, 10th=1. Bonus: Fastest lap=1 point (if in top 10). Strategy: Consistency beats occasional wins. P5 every race > P1 then DNF. Protect points when leading championship.",

    "question": "When should I take risks vs play it safe?",
    "answer": "Take risks when: Behind in championship, late in season, need positions, nothing to lose. Play safe when: Leading championship, early in season, in points position, mechanical issues. Calculate: Is potential gain worth potential loss? P5 guaranteed vs 50% chance at P3 (risk DNF) = take P5 if leading.",

    "answer": "Season planning: 1) Set realistic goals (target position), 2) Identify key races (double points, home tracks), 3) Budget resources (tires, parts, testing), 4) Plan improvements (weak areas), 5) Monitor rivals. Review after each race: On target? Adjust strategy? What to improve?",
