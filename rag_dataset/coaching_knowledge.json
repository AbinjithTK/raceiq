    "question": "What is the optimal racing line?",
    "answer": "The optimal racing line maximizes corner exit speed: 1) Enter wide (use full track width), 2) Turn in at the right point (varies by corner), 3) Hit the apex at minimum speed (late apex usually best), 4) Exit wide with full throttle. Key principle: 'Slow in, fast out' - prioritize exit speed, especially before straights. Sacrifice entry speed for better exit.",

    "question": "How do I improve my braking?",
    "answer": "Effective braking technique: 1) Brake in a straight line (before turn-in), 2) Apply maximum pressure quickly (70-85 bar), 3) Trail brake: gradually release as you turn in, 4) Feel for lock-up (reduce pressure if wheels lock), 5) Finish braking before apex. Common mistakes: Braking too early (slow), too late (miss apex), or too long (slow corner speed). Practice threshold braking.",

    "question": "How do I apply throttle smoothly?",
    "answer": "Smooth throttle application: 1) Begin at apex (when unwinding steering), 2) Progressive application (0% → 100% gradually), 3) Match to steering angle (less steering = more throttle), 4) Feel for wheelspin (back off if rear slides), 5) Full throttle when straight. Aggressive throttle causes wheelspin (slow) and tire wear. Smooth = fast.",

    "question": "How do I approach different corner types?",
    "answer": "Corner strategies: Slow corners (hairpins): Late apex, prioritize exit. Medium corners: Balanced approach, smooth arc. Fast corners: Early apex, maintain momentum, brave on entry. Chicanes: Straight-line as much as possible, late apex on exit. Decreasing radius: Early turn-in, careful on exit. Increasing radius: Late apex, accelerate early. Always consider what follows the corner.",

    "question": "How do I drive more consistently?",
    "answer": "Build consistency through: 1) Reference points (braking markers, turn-in points, apexes), 2) Repeatable technique (same inputs every lap), 3) Smooth driving (no sudden movements), 4) Mental focus (stay present, don't think ahead), 5) Physical fitness (fatigue kills consistency). Aim for ±0.5s lap time variation. Consistency beats occasional fast laps.",
