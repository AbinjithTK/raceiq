{"id": "rag_0116", "question": "How does wind affect car performance and strategy?", "answer": "Wind significantly impacts racing: 1) Aerodynamic balance - Headwind increases downforce and drag (slower straights, better corners). Tailwind reduces downforce (faster straights, less grip in corners). 2) Crosswind effects - Pushes car sideways, especially in high-speed corners, requiring steering corrections and affecting braking points. 3) Consistency challenges - Changing wind direction lap-to-lap makes car behavior unpredictable. 4) Strategic implications - Strong headwind on main straight may favor later pit stops (less time lost). 5) Driver adaptation - Must adjust braking points and corner entry speeds based on wind.
