    "question": "How does rain fundamentally change racing?",
    "answer": "Rain transforms racing dynamics: 1) Grip reduction - Wet tracks have 30-50% less grip than dry, increasing braking distances by 50-100%. 2) Aquaplaning risk - Standing water causes tires to lose contact with track surface above certain speeds. 3) Tire strategy - Critical decisions: When to switch from wets to intermediates to slicks as track dries. Wrong timing costs 10-30 seconds. 4) Driver skill amplification - Mistakes are easier to make and harder to recover from. The best wet-weather drivers gain 1-2 seconds per lap. 5) Visibility - Spray from cars ahead reduces vision, requiring trust and instinct. 6) Racing line changes - Dry line may not be fastest; look for grip off-line.",

    "question": "How does temperature affect car and driver performance?",
    "answer": "Temperature has multiple critical effects: 1) Tire performance - Cold (<15°C): Hard to warm tires, less grip. Optimal (25-35°C): Best performance. Hot (>40°C): Accelerated degradation, potential overheating. 2) Track temp - Hot track increases tire wear by 20-40%, requiring earlier pit stops or pace management. 3) Engine cooling - High temps risk overheating; teams may reduce power or increase cooling (costs speed). 4) Driver fatigue - Cockpit temps above 50°C increase fatigue, affecting concentration and reaction times. 5) Brake performance - Cold brakes need warming; hot brakes risk fade. Temperature management is crucial for consistent performance.",

    "question": "How does wind affect car performance and strategy?",
    "answer": "Wind significantly impacts racing: 1) Aerodynamic balance - Headwind increases downforce and drag (slower straights, better corners). Tailwind reduces downforce (faster straights, less grip in corners). 2) Crosswind effects - Pushes car sideways, especially in high-speed corners, requiring steering corrections and affecting braking points. 3) Consistency challenges - Changing wind direction lap-to-lap makes car behavior unpredictable. 4) Strategic implications - Strong headwind on main straight may favor later pit stops (less time lost). 5) Driver adaptation - Must adjust braking points and corner entry speeds based on wind. Strong winds can change lap times by 0.5-1.5 seconds.",

    "question": "How do drivers handle poor visibility?",
    "answer": "Poor visibility requires special skills: 1) Rain spray - Following cars create walls of spray; must rely on memory and instinct for braking points. 2) Fog conditions - Reduce speed, increase following distance, use reference points on track edges. 3) Night racing - Headlights create shadows and depth perception issues; memorize track features. 4) Sun glare - Blinding at certain corners; use visor, adjust line to avoid direct sun. 5) Trust and experience - Experienced drivers can maintain pace with limited vision by trusting their preparation. 6) Safety first - Better to lose 2-3 seconds per lap than crash. Visibility issues separate experienced drivers from novices.",

    "question": "How do you make tire choice decisions in changing weather?",
    "answer": "Tire strategy in mixed conditions is critical: 1) Track wetness assessment - Full wets for standing water, intermediates for damp, slicks for dry. 2) Timing the switch - Too early to slicks = no grip and tire damage. Too late = losing 2-3 seconds per lap. 3) Track drying patterns - Some corners dry faster (sun exposure, wind, racing line). 4) Risk vs reward - Leading: Conservative approach. Mid-pack: Can gamble for positions. 5) Weather radar - Monitor approaching rain to time pit stops. 6) Competitor watching - See what others do, learn from their mistakes. One perfect tire call can win a race; one bad call can lose it. This is where experience and data analysis combine.",
