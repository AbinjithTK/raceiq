    "question": "What is understeer and how do I fix it?",
    "answer": "Understeer = front tires lose grip first, car won't turn. Causes: Too much entry speed, early throttle, wrong line. Fixes: Brake earlier, slower entry, later apex, trail brake more, reduce mid-corner throttle. Driving around it requires patience.",

    "question": "What is oversteer and how do I fix it?",
    "answer": "Oversteer = rear tires lose grip first, car rotates too much. Causes: Too much throttle, lift-off mid-corner, aggressive inputs. Fixes: Smoother throttle, avoid sudden lift, earlier apex, reduce trail braking. Catch slides early with steering correction.",

    "question": "How does weight transfer affect handling?",
    "answer": "Weight transfer: Braking = weight to front (more front grip). Accelerating = weight to rear (more rear grip). Cornering = weight to outside. Use it: Trail brake to keep weight on front for turn-in, smooth throttle to transfer weight to rear for traction.",

    "answer": "Tire pressure effects: Too low = more grip but overheats, wears faster. Too high = less grip, bouncy, uneven wear. Optimal: 30-35 PSI (hot) for GR86. Adjust: +2 PSI if overheating, -2 PSI if not warming up. Check after 3-5 laps when hot.",
