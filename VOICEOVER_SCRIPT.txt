[00:00 - 00:15]
Meet RaceIQ - your AI-powered race engineer that turns raw telemetry into winning strategies. Let's see it in action with real Toyota GR Cup data from Barber Motorsports Park.

================================================================================
SECTION 1: LIVE TELEMETRY
================================================================================

[00:15 - 00:30]
Here's live telemetry visualization. Watch as we track speed, braking pressure, and G-forces around every corner.

[00:30 - 00:45]
The 3D track map shows exactly where you are, with real-time coaching tips appearing at critical points - brake earlier here, carry more speed through turn 5.

================================================================================
SECTION 2: AI COACHING INSIGHTS
================================================================================

[00:45 - 01:00]
The AI analyzes your driving against the fastest laps in the dataset. It identifies exactly where you're losing time.

[01:00 - 01:10]
Sector 2 - you're losing 0.8 seconds. The AI suggests: 'Trail brake deeper into turn 7, maintain higher minimum speed.'

[01:10 - 01:20]
Your lap potential shows you're capable of a 1:42.3 - that's 1.2 seconds faster than your current best.

================================================================================
SECTION 3: RACE STRATEGY
================================================================================

[01:20 - 01:35]
Now for race strategy. The system predicts tire degradation based on your driving style and track conditions.

[01:35 - 01:45]
Your fronts will drop off after lap 18. The AI recommends pitting on lap 19 during the yellow flag window.

[01:45 - 01:55]
Pit prediction accounts for traffic, fuel load, and tire wear - giving you the optimal strategy to gain positions.

================================================================================
SECTION 4: CROSS-TRACK ANALYSIS
================================================================================

[01:55 - 02:08]
Here's where it gets powerful. Compare your performance across multiple tracks.

[02:08 - 02:25]
You're strong in high-speed corners but losing time in technical sections. The AI identifies this pattern across all circuits and suggests specific drills to improve.

================================================================================
CLOSING
